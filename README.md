## Installation <a name="Installation"></a>
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation <a name="Project"></a>
For my Data Scientist Nanodegree Program by Udacity, I was interested the 2019 Soccer Player information from the top 9 European Leagues to gain insights regarding:

- Which European soccer league has the highest average market value per player?
- Does the position (Goalkepper, Defense, Midfield, Forward) correlate with the market value of a player?
- Does the age affect the market value of a player?
- Can you predict the league of a player based on his specific position, nationality and market value by using the k-nearest-neighbor (KNN) classifier? 

## File Descriptions <a name="File"></a>
There is one Jupyter Notebook which includes the analysis to answer the questions above. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the process from gathering and assessing the data to cleaning, modelling and visualizing it.

## Results <a name="Results"></a>
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here.
