## <a name="Installation"></a>Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## <a name="Project"></a>Project Motivation
For my Data Scientist Nanodegree Program by Udacity, I was interested the 2019 Soccer Player information from the top 9 European Leagues to gain insights regarding:

- How are the market values distributed?
- What's the average market value by position?
- Which league has the highest average market value per player?
- Which clubs has the highest average market value per player?
- Who are the most valuable soccer players?
- Can you predict the league of a player based on his specific position, nationality and market value by using the k-nearest-neighbor (KNN) classifier? 

## <a name="File"></a>File Descriptions
There is one Jupyter Notebook which includes the analysis to answer the questions above. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the process from gathering and assessing the data to cleaning, modeling and visualizing it.

## <a name="Results"></a>Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here.
